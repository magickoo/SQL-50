1) using OR
#OR
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000

2) using Union
#Union
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 
union
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE population >= 25000000

conc: Union is faster tha OR when it comes to cases like scan two different column like this.
